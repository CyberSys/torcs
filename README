Introduction
------------

This is an all in one package of TORCS. Be aware that some included
artwork has non free (in the GPL sense) licenses, you will find a "readme.txt"
in those directories. The rest is either licenced under the GPL or the Free
Art license.

Non-Free content (in GPL sense)
-------------------------------
Here the list with the directories containing non free content, look at the
readme.txt for details:
- data/cars/models/pw-*
- data/cars/models/kc-*
- data/cars/models/vm-*


Linux Installation from Source
-------------------------------
- requires plib 1.8.3, FreeGLUT or GLUT, be aware to compile plib with -fPIC on AMD64.
- untar the archive
- cd into the torcs-1.2.4 directory
- ./configure (use --help for showing the options, of interest might be
  --enable-debug and --disable-xrandr).
- make
- make install
- make datainstall
- start with "torcs"

Command line arguments:
-s do not use multitexturing.
-d start with gdb and show a backtrace on crash (helps most combined with
   --enable-debug at configure time).

Windows Installation from Source
--------------------------------
- requires VC++ 6.0
- untar the archive into a path without whitespaces and special characters.
- cd into the torcs-1.2.4 directory
- run setup_win32.bat
- run setup_win32-data-from-CVS.bat
- open "TORCS.dsw" with VC++ 6.0, hit cancel for the missing projects.
- do not try to build a debug version, the projects are not set up!
- select the TORCS project and the w32-Release version
- compile project
- cd into the "runtime" directory.
- run "wtorcs.exe"

Windows Binary Installation
---------------------------
- unzip the archive
- cd into the torcs-1.2.4 directory
- run "wtorcs.exe"

Testing
-------
Please pick bugs below and retest them (you can find the original reports on
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=3777&atid=103777, select "any" bugs to
see as well the closed ones). If you find problems which should be already
fixed or new ones please report them to the torcs-users mailing list.
Additionally it would be interesting to know if PPC and AMD64 builds compile
and run (I have no such boxes to try).

Getting Help
------------
During the game press F1. For more in depth information visit www.torcs.org,
you find there a lot of information, look at the documentation section on
the left, have as well a look into the list of howto's. If you are stuck
have a look into the FAQ to learn how and where to report a problem.

Have fun, bye

Bernhard.

TODO for 1.2.4 (estimate: early July)
--------------
- Fix new introduced bugs.
- Fix XSLT/DTD for viewing results (Report by Eugen)
- Fix (windows) trackgen.
- Fix strdup (for FreeBSD).
- (Improve collision).
- OpenAL (plib causes too much trouble on Windows).
- Hunting lost open filehandles if any left.
- S3TC Option for all textures (with option).
- Scale down for all textures on load (user adjustable to improve performance).
- Bugfixes and cleanup.
- Rework g-track-1 (format version 4, add pits on straight, update artwork).
- Add cameras (alpine, spring)
- solution for varying gl headers (include mesa headers into the source?)
- Sound performance problem (no facts, just a feeling at the moment, wait for
  feedback), review?
- likewise olethros_2005 to olethros.
- Add validation for the case no driver selected, do not exit to
  console.
- (Sound did not work well with 40 cars, investigate). [probably due to plib]
- try to resolve "(null)" texture problem (seems to be in the model files).
- rework free car models (several holes, no emmissive color of lod (model
  becomes dark at a certain distance), single sided).
- fix driver list with more than 100 entries (number cut).
- add RtBarrierNormalG() and use it in simuv*.
- fix sound in split screen multiplayer. [in progress]
- add more races to championship.
- Fix non ending races because of failing virtual crane.
- Problem when driver list changes during championship.
- Investigate non reproducable (so far) crash after changing properties in
  multiple players (human) and then doing a race with 2 players. Happend just
  after a fresh install and just once so far (is one of the shipped xml files
  broken)? [note there are many other crashes when using the menus, seemingly
  at random times].
- in long races car-to-car collisions fail somehow sometimes -> investigate
- pit wall collision
- before/at release: credits update
  Olaf Sassnick -> porsche improvment -> the_penguin@gmx.at
  Christophe Macours -> sound samples -> http://users.belgacom.net/samples/
  Charalampos Alexopoulos -> track editor ->  http://katergo.rege.org/projects/trackeditor/


TODO for 1.2.5
--------------
- All the new and postponed stuff.
- Fix more memory leaks (already hunt down a LOT there are still more).
- make use of pbuffers to render trackmap if available.
- Add valgrind option to "torcs".
- Include suppressions file for valgrind.
- (Automate GL features verification).
- (Free camera controlled with mouse and keys).
- (Fix parallel build with make -j n, breaks currently in SOLID).
- Improve visual quality of some existing tracks (e.g. e-track-1, alborg, ...).
- Texture clamp to edge needs explicit setting in nvidia driver tab in windows,
  have a look into that (otherwise the border is not taken as color around the
  pit door, pits are quite dark around the logo).
- (Problem with BRD Sim-pro in windows, investigate)
- pit wall collision
- check and merge Christos camera code.
- (Add billy, astigot).
- Integrate documentation into CVS/distribution
- merge berniw_2004 code into berniw's (rescheduled, a bit more testing will
  not hurt).
- SDL port (or 1.3.0 or 1.4.0, not decided finally)
- review simuv2
- possibility of one pit for 2 cars of one module.
- fix tools (accc, trackgen, etc, these are way too touchy).
- make trackgen generate two sides for barriers (better diffuse lighting).


TODO LATER
----------
- Fix more memory leaks (already hunt down a LOT there are still more).
- Replace vector/matrix oprations with an efficient implementation (-> use
  SIMD, e.g. enhanced version of v2/v3d.h with SIMD alternatives if compilers
  are not more clever at this time (currently they suck on useful vectorizing)).
- SMP simulaton core (for myself).
- Replays.
- Setup editor (add a function to the robot interface to ask the robot
  about the location or a file handle for its setup file, perhaps a
  close function is needed as well).
- Telemetry recorder/viewer.
- Networking (2.0).
- Redesign/Reimplement multitexturing and fileformat.
- Apply light maps to skid marks, smoke and wheels, etc.
- Phong specular highlights (optional env, cube or GLSL).
- Shadowmapped/Stenciled dynamic car shadows.
- Compile/crosscompile on MinGW/Cygwin/Linux for Windows native.
- so/dll with libtool, common code?
- 3d-grass.
- Dynamic sky.
- Pace car and trucks to remove wrecks (remove "virtual" crane).
- More Rules.
- TRB integration.
- Fix/create new simu/switch to updated/new simu.
- (clean up simuv3 conflicts)
- Show just fitting resolutions for fullscreen/change for windowed mode.
- Make it possible for a robot module to carry any arbitrary number of
  drivers (instead of static 10).
- Solve problem of wheels cutting the car body (stencil?).
- Nicer Tires, a bit more round, better lighting.
- Separate components more clean (e.g. ssgInit should go back to
  ssggraph, etc.)
- persistent skidmarks (simply put them back into the shadowmap after
  the race? Extra texture? Just restore them?), restore function.
- Make Windows debug build work.
- Fix windows project such that it compiles in all locations (currently it
  fails if special characters are in the path).
- Avoid cameras cutting the landscape.
- Rework models (holes, just single sided polygons for culling, etc.)
- Check (and fix if neccessary) screenshots on Windows, still wrong gamma?
- Fix border transparency (fences, pit barrier -> rename "trans-*"?).
- API to change setup during the practice mode.
- Timed races (e.g. 24h).
- Allow more mouse events /suggested by Frieder -> mouse wheel for gear
  switching).
- Start position marks on track (same technique like fake shadow, skids).
- Start procedures (pace car, etc).
- Better transparency for track objects.
- More driving aids, switch to AI and back.
- localization (e.g English, French, German, ...).
- add compatibility lib for strndup etc. on win32.
- New GUI.
- driving/races in reverse track direction.
- Check for consistency of simuv2/simuv3.
- verify that simulation obeys conservation of momentum and energy.
- optimise simuv3.
- Fix engine inertia/s of F1 cars, check/fix all other cars as well.
- Opponent sets for human players (e.g 20 Open Wheel cars, etc.)

IDEAS FOR MUCH LATER
--------------------
- Weather.
- Dynamic day/night-time, car lights with projective texturing.
- Pit crew.
- Dynamic "intelligent" Objects (e.g. Helicopter)
- Solid/dynamic obstacles.
- Nicer trees etc, terrain LOD.
- Inside view.
- Animated driver.
- Dirt on cars, inside view.
- free terrain.
- Open track dynamically generated when driving.
- Random track generator.
- Separate pit path, Y segments, etc?
- TORCS as benchmark or screensaver?
- Switch to rigid body engine?
- Force feedback.
- (Compressed data files?)
- Story mode with message.
- Traffic simulator
