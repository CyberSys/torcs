Introduction
------------

This is an all in one package of TORCS. Be aware that some included
artwork has non free (in the GPL sense) licenses, you will find a "readme.txt"
in those directories. The rest is either licenced under the GPL or the Free
Art license.

Non-Free content (in GPL sense)
-------------------------------
Here the list with the directories containing non free content, look at the
readme.txt for details:
- data/cars/models/pw-*
- data/cars/models/kc-*
- data/cars/models/vm-*


Linux Installation from Source
-------------------------------
- requires plib 1.8.3, FreeGLUT or GLUT, be aware to compile plib with -fPIC on AMD64.
- requires OpenAL from www.torcs.org for best sound quality.
- untar the archive
- cd into the torcs-1.2.4 directory
- ./configure (use --help for showing the options, of interest might be
  --enable-debug and --disable-xrandr).
- make
- make install
- make datainstall
- start with "torcs"

Command line arguments:
-s do not use multitexturing.
-d start with gdb and show a backtrace on crash (helps most combined with
   --enable-debug at configure time).

- Applied more patches from Debian for AMD64 (Rudy Godoy, Bernhard).
- Smoke code cleanup and improvment (Christos, Bernhard).
- grey-tracks.rgb downsized (Bernhard).
- Updated clkdtm (Eliam Speedychonchon, Bernhard).
- Fixed fence transparency of g-track-3 and spring (Bernhard).
- Visualize clutch command value (Bernhard).
- Simplyfied conditional compiling in grtrackmap.cpp, it requires now OpenGL
  1.3 compatible header files. (Bernhard).
- Added configure test for GL_ARB_texture_compression (Bernhard).
- Added configure test for GL_VERSION_1_3 (Bernhard).
- Disabled mipmapping of "*shadow*" texture files (Bernhard).
- Backface culling for car shadow (Bernhard).
- Added texture compression (Bernhard).
- Added texture downscaling (Bernhard).
- Fixed an issue in sound/simu config screen (after changing values and hitting
  cancel the fields did not represent the current settings) (Bernhard).
- Added OpenGL configuration screen (Bernhard).
- Fixed inconsistency of texture loaders, "_nmm" is now obsolete, use "_n"
  (Bernhard).
- Improved Makefiles of alpine-1, g-track-3 and ole-road-1 (Bernhard).
- New sound architecture/implementation with a plib and OpenAL backend
  (Christos).
- Changes in sound menu for new sound implementation, added volume (Christos).
- Optimized ole-road-1 (Christos).
- Updated pit door (Speedychonchon).
- Fixed Windows version memory management bugs in tgf.cpp (malloc, realloc),
  this should solve some trackgen/accc problems in Windows (Bernhard).
- Updated FAQ (Bernhard).
- Fixed closing of invalid file handle in maintrackgen.cpp (Bernhard).
- Fixed a bug in the msh files generated by trackgen which caused AC3D to
  crash (Bernhard).
- Fixed missing check if model file could be loaded in elevation.cpp
  (Bernhard).
- Fixed non working trackgen -H option in Linux (Bernhard).
- Fixed gamma value in image loader of elevation map loader of trackgen,
  must currently match with the default in img.cpp (Bernhard).
- reviewed "(null)" texture problem and found it harmless, no immediate action
  needed. Its actually a "bug" of the ac files and happend on retexturing/
  "untexturing" objects. Perhaps it is not anymore the case with newer
  versions (Bernhard).
- Reworked g-track-1 (Bernhard).
- Fixed lighting (material) properties of some models to fix the "darkening
  on LOD switch problem". On some models it helps, other models need to
  be rewoked later (the problem there seems to be the model itself -> normals)
  (Bernhard).
- Fixed strndup for FreeBSD (Thierry Thomas, Bernhard).
- Fixed a bug in collision detection which happend when 2 wrecks where
  overlapping. This caused permanent collisions, which in turn avoided to call
  dtProceed and therefore avoided the needed update of the data (Bernhard).
- Fixed: non ending races because of failing virtual crane, was a floating
  point error accumulation problem in simu.cpp (Bernhard).
- Barrier has now a field with normal used for barrier collision detection,
  reworked SimCarCollideXYScene, collide.cpp (Bernhard).
- Added vector classes, such that all berniw/bt derivates can use the same
  copy, instead of having a copy in each bot (Bernhard).
- Collision code refactoring/cleanup, removed doubled code, etc. (Bernhard).
- Initial wall collision support, good enough for now, but needs
  improvment and more testing. The damage is currently set very low, such
  that the robots have some time to adopt (Bernhard).
- Fixed skid sound at low speeds (Christos, Bernhard).
- Fixed scroll lists numbering with more than 100 entries (Bernhard).
- Enabled configure checking for OpenAL (Bernhard).
- Fixed skidmarks when driving in reverse, bug introduced by me when enabling
  backface-culling for skids (Christos, Bernhard).
- Added trackgen option to just calculate the track parameters (Charalampos).
- Increased a "margin" in trackgens track.cpp, will need further inverstigation
  (Charalampos).


TODO for 1.2.4
--------------
- Fix XSLT/DTD for viewing results (Report by Eugen)
- Hunting lost open filehandles if any left.
- Bugfixes and cleanup.
- Add cameras (alpine, spring)
- align widgets in sound config screen.
- check for ssgSimpleStates and replace with grManagedState where appropriate.
- Check for lost open filehandles in Windows module loader.
- Olethros bot: disable writing, init mem leak, textures, warning in learning lib.
- plib backend, missing sound effects (would be nice)?
- Update sound maximum 30-50 times a second (perhaps this helps with the plib
  timing problem).
- Does sound stop in menus?
- grep for strndups not guarded by portability.h.
- Windows port.
- Windows installer.
- All-in-one.
- Linux installer.
- Separated packages.
- Prepare docs (Robot tutorial -> OpenAL section, installation etc).
- before/at release: credits update
  Olaf Sassnick -> porsche improvment -> the_penguin@gmx.at
  Christophe Macours -> sound samples -> http://users.belgacom.net/samples/
  Charalampos Alexopoulos -> track editor ->  http://katergo.rege.org/projects/trackeditor/


TODO for 1.2.5
--------------
- Check for memory leaks.
- make use of pbuffers to render trackmap if available.
- Add valgrind option to "torcs".
- Include suppressions file for valgrind.
- (Fix parallel build with make -j n, breaks currently in SOLID).
- Ongoing for every release: rework free car models (several holes, no
  emmissive color of lod (model becomes dark at a certain distance), single
  sided, add cockpit, lods).
- Ongoing for every release: Improve visual quality of some existing tracks
  (e.g. e-track-3, michigan, eventually wheel-1, e-track-2).
- Texture clamp to edge needs explicit setting in nvidia driver tab in windows,
  have a look into that (otherwise the border is not taken as color around the
  pit door, pits are quite dark around the logo).
- check and merge Christos camera code.
- Integrate documentation into CVS/distribution
- merge berniw_2004 code into berniw's (rescheduled, a bit more testing will
  not hurt).
- SDL port (or 1.3.0 or 1.4.0, not decided finally)
- review simuv2
- possibility of one pit for 2 cars of one module.
- fix tools (accc, trackgen, etc, these are way too touchy).
- make trackgen generate two sides for barriers and use just one sided
  polygons (better diffuse lighting).
- fix sound in split screen multiplayer. [in progress]
- Investigate non reproducable (so far) crash after changing properties in
  multiple players (human) and then doing a race with 2 players. Happend just
  after a fresh install and just once so far (is one of the shipped xml files
  broken)? [note there are many other crashes when using the menus, seemingly
  at random times].
- Add remaining kcendra cars.
- Ongoing: Replace some defines with "static const" to be able to see the
  symbol name when debugging.
- berniw/bt/sparkle: make use of classes in lib/math.
- Investigate/fix crash on rainbowroad (happens as well with 1.2.3). RtTrackGlobal2Local
  seems to deliver nonsense, could be caused by trackloader through unusual turn
  angles (e.g. > 180deg). Check if this problem just occurs on version 3 tracks.
- Problem when driver list changes during championship.
- add more races to championship.
- move berniw/bt spline code into math to share it.


TODO LATER
----------
- Add validation for the case no driver selected, do not exit to
  console.
- Fix more memory leaks (already hunt down a LOT there are still more).
- Networking (2.0).
- Replace vector/matrix oprations with an efficient implementation (-> use
  SIMD, e.g. enhanced version of v2/v3d.h with SIMD alternatives if compilers
  are not more clever at this time (currently they suck on useful vectorizing)).
- SMP simulaton core (for myself).
- Replays.
- Setup editor (add a function to the robot interface to ask the robot
  about the location or a file handle for its setup file, perhaps a
  close function is needed as well).
- Telemetry recorder/viewer.
- Redesign/Reimplement multitexturing and fileformat.
- Apply light maps to skid marks, smoke and wheels, etc.
- Phong specular highlights (optional env, cube or GLSL).
- Shadowmapped/Stenciled dynamic car shadows.
- Compile/crosscompile on MinGW/Cygwin/Linux for Windows native.
- so/dll with libtool, common code?
- 3d-grass.
- Dynamic sky.
- Pace car and trucks to remove wrecks (remove "virtual" crane).
- More Rules.
- TRB integration.
- Fix/create new simu/switch to updated/new simu.
- (clean up simuv3 conflicts)
- Show just fitting resolutions for fullscreen/change for windowed mode.
- Make it possible for a robot module to carry any arbitrary number of
  drivers (instead of static 10).
- Solve problem of wheels cutting the car body (stencil?).
- Nicer Tires, a bit more round, better lighting.
- Separate components more clean (e.g. ssgInit should go back to
  ssggraph, etc.)
- persistent skidmarks (simply put them back into the shadowmap after
  the race? Extra texture? Just restore them?), restore function.
- Make Windows debug build work.
- Fix windows project such that it compiles in all locations (currently it
  fails if special characters are in the path).
- Avoid cameras cutting the landscape.
- Rework models (holes, just single sided polygons for culling, etc.)
- Check (and fix if neccessary) screenshots on Windows, still wrong gamma?
- API to change setup during the practice mode.
- Timed races (e.g. 24h).
- Allow more mouse events /suggested by Frieder -> mouse wheel for gear
  switching).
- Start position marks on track (same technique like fake shadow, skids).
- Start procedures (pace car, etc).
- Better transparency for track objects.
- More driving aids, switch to AI and back.
- localization (e.g English, French, German, ...).
- add compatibility lib for strndup etc. on win32.
- New GUI.
- driving/races in reverse track direction.
- Check for consistency of simuv2/simuv3.
- verify that simulation obeys conservation of momentum and energy.
- optimise simuv3.
- Fix engine inertia/s of F1 cars, check/fix all other cars as well.
- Opponent sets for human players (e.g 20 Open Wheel cars, etc.)
- Free camera controlled with mouse and keys.
- Automate GL features verification (hopefully obsolete).
- Investigate the oscillation and roughness problems reported by Christos.


IDEAS FOR MUCH LATER
--------------------
- Weather.
- Dynamic day/night-time, car lights with projective texturing.
- Pit crew.
- Dynamic "intelligent" Objects (e.g. Helicopter)
- Solid/dynamic obstacles.
- Nicer trees etc, terrain LOD.
- Inside view.
- Animated driver.
- Dirt on cars, inside view.
- free terrain.
- Open track dynamically generated when driving.
- Random track generator.
- Separate pit path, Y segments, etc?
- TORCS as benchmark or screensaver?
- Switch to rigid body engine?
- Force feedback.
- (Compressed data files?)
- Story mode with message.
- Traffic simulator
