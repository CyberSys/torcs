		 already been extended to Algorithm UCT which works for
		 minimax tree search. We have developed a Monte-Carlo
		 program, MoGo, which is the first computer Go program
		 using UCT. We explain our modifications of UCT for Go
		 application, among which efficient memory management,
		 parametrization, ordering of non-visited nodes and
		 parallelization. MoGo is now a top-level Computer-Go
		 program on 9 x 9 Go board.",
