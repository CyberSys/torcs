Building Windows Installer for TORCS
------------------------------------
Required tools from nsis.sourceforge.net:
- NSIS 2.06
- HM NIS EDIT 2.0.3

- Build a TORCS release and copy the runtime directory into this (here).
- Rename the runtime to base.
- Open torcs.nsi with HM NIS EDIT 2.0.3 and compile the installer.


Updating the torcs.nsi file
---------------------------
- Because the above tools do NOT yet support the maintainance with the gui,
  here are some notes of me and for me.
- Install cygwin.
- Install previous TORCS version, assume path is torcspath. Important: do not
  run it, generated files could confuse us.
- compile new final version, do not run it, we assume it is in directory
  CWD/base.
- Get different files:

		diff -rq base torcspath > gaga

- We are just interested in vanished/new files for the installer, create a
  template for file lines in the script, is good for existing directories with
  additional content (one line):

		cat gaga | sed 's/\(.*\)\(base.*\): \(.*\)$/  File "\2\/\3"/g' |
		sed 's/\//\\/g' | grep -v Only

- If a whole new tree should be added (e.g. olethros), do this (one line), be
  aware that the order needs some fixing afterwards:

		find base/drivers/olethros -name "*" | sed 's/\//\\/g' |
		sed 's/^\(.*\.[a-z]\{3\}\)$/  File "\1"/g' |
		sed 's/^base\(.*\)$/  SetOutPath "$INSTDIR\1"/g'

- Run the installer and install to a clean directory, check with diff against
  the fresh built tree from above.
