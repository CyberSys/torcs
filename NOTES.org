* Notes on TORCS
  Based on Ubuntu 16.04

* Prequisites

These are the packages needed to built TORCS
```
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt install libgl1-mesa-dev
sudo apt install freeglut3-dev
sudo apt install libplib-dev
sudo apt install libopenal-dev
sudo apt install libalut-dev
sudo apt install libvorbis-dev
sudo apt install libxi-dev
sudo apt install libxmu-dev
sudo apt install libxrender-dev
sudo apt install libxrandr-dev
sudo apt install libz-dev
sudo apt install libpng-dev
```

These are the packages needed to build the documentation
```
sudo apt install doxygen
sudo apt install graphviz
sudo apt install texlive
```

Documentation is built using `make doc` and will fail the first time (possible doxygen bug). Just type `q` to go into batchmode. Let it complete and then retry `make doc` and it should build without problem.

* Checking out

Beware - there are various slightly different versions of the instructions for checking out from CVS. Use the wrong one and you'll get an ancient version of TORCS!
```
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@torcs.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/torcs login
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@torcs.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/torcs co -r r1-3-1 -P torcs
```

*Note in particular* that you need the r1-3-1 branch in order to get the latest code.

Available branches appear to be:
```
MAIN
r1-2-0-maint
r1-3-1
r1-3-x
```
