<h2>berniw development snapshot for torcs-1.0.0-pre7</h2>

<h3>1.0 what is berniw?</h3>

<p>
berniw is a car driver for the open racing car simulator, look at <a href="http://torcs.org">
torcs.org</a>. at this place i would like to thank the developers of torcs, i had a lot of fun
during the development of this driver, they do a great job:-)
</p>

<h3>1.1 license and download</h3>

<p>
gnu general public license 2. anyway, please don't look too hard in the code yet, or my reputation
will be lost...;-). download it <a href="download/berniw.tar.bz2">  here</a>. if you get the CVS
version of torcs, you don't need this package, berniw is already included.
</p>

<h3>1.2 how do i install berniw?</h3>

<p>
so, first you need a working version of torcs 1.0.0-pre7 under linux with sources installed. i
assume in this instructions the following:<br>   you have the permisson on the system to do the
needed tasks. the torcs sources  are in /usr/src/torcs/torcs-1.0.0-pre7 and the installation is in
/usr/local/games/torcs.  in case you use other directories, just replace this directories with the
ones on your system. i also assume that the <a  href="download/berniw.tar.bz2">  berniw.tar.bz2</a>
is in your home directory.
<br>
<br>
first export the following environment variables (for bash):
<br>
export TORCS_BASE=/usr/src/torcs/torcs-1.0.0-pre7
<br>
export MAKE_DEFAULT=/usr/src/torcs/torcs-1.0.0-pre7/Make-default.mk
<br>
<br>
now change to the drivers directory:
<br>
cd $TORCS_BASE/src/drivers
<br>
<br>
unpack the berniw package:
<br>
tar xfvI ~/berniw.tar.bz2
<br>
<br>
compile and install:
<br>
cd berniw
<br>
make
<br>
make install
<br>
if you discover trouble send me a mail to berni4you@gmx.ch.<br>
<br>
run it:
<br>
cd /usr/local/games/torcs
<br>
./torcs
<br>
now choose a berniw, have fun.
