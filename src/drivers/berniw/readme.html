<h2>berniw development snapshot for torcs-1.0.0-pre7</h2>
<h3>1.0 what is berniw?</h3>
  berniw is a car driver for the open racing car simulator, look at <a href="http://torcs.org">
 torcs.org</a>. at this place i would like to thank the developers of torcs, 
i had a lot of fun during the development of this driver, they do a great 
job:-)  
<h3>1.1 license and download</h3>
  gnu general public license 2. anyway, please don't look too hard in the 
code yet, or my reputation will be lost...;-). download it <a href="download/berniw.tar.bz2">
 here</a>.  
<h3>1.2 how do i install berniw?</h3>
  so, first you need a working version of torcs 1.0.0-pre7 under linux with
 sources installed. i assume in this instructions the following:<br>
  you have the permisson on the system to do the needed tasks. the torcs
sources  are in /usr/src/torcs/torcs-1.0.0-pre7 and the installation is in
/usr/local/games/torcs.  in case you use other directories, just replace
this directories with the  ones on your system. i also assume that the <a href="download/berniw.tar.bz2">
 berniw.tar.bz2</a> is in your home directory.<br>
<br>
  first export the following environment variables (for bash):<br>
  export TORCS_BASE=/usr/src/torcs/torcs-1.0.0-pre7<br>
  export MAKE_DEFAULT=/usr/src/torcs/torcs-1.0.0-pre7/Make-default.mk<br>
<br>
  now change to the drivers directory:<br>
  cd $TORCS_BASE/src/drivers<br>
<br>
  unpack the berniw package:<br>
  tar xfvI ~/berniw.tar.bz2<br>
<br>
  compile and install:<br>
  cd berniw<br>
  make<br>
  make install<br>
  if you discover trouble send me a mail to berni4you@gmx.ch.<br>
<br>
  run it:<br>
  cd /usr/local/games/torcs<br>
  ./torcs<br>
  now choose a berniw, have fun.<br>
<h3>1.3 features</h3>
 - pit stop<br>
  - simple collision avoidance<br>
  - stays quite good on various tracks<br>
<h3>1.4 TODO</h3>
 - bug fixing<br>
 - just compute things if neccessary, not always.<br>
  - MUCH better trajectory (race and pit, the current one is a big mess)<br>
  - better collision avoidance<br>
  - overtaking<br>
  - artwork / different cars<br>
  - setups for the different tracks<br>
  - better strategy<br>
  - communication between berniw's (save fuel behind team mate, block opponents,
 let pass team mates, etc.)<br>
  - improve behavior model<br>
  - clean up code<br>
