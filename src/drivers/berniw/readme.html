<h2>berniw development snapshot for torcs-1.0.0</h2>

<h3>1.0 what is berniw?</h3>

<p>
berniw is a car driver for the open racing car simulator, look at <a href="http://torcs.org">
torcs.org</a>. at this place i would like to thank the developers of torcs, i had a lot of fun
during the development of this driver, they do a great job:-)
</p>

<h3>1.1 license and download</h3>

<p>
gnu general public license 2. anyway, please don't look too hard in the code yet, or my reputation
will be lost...;-). download it <a href="download/berniw.tar.bz2">  here</a>. if you get the CVS
version of torcs, you don't need this package, berniw is already included.
</p>

<h3>1.2 how do i install berniw?</h3>

<p>
so, first you need a working version of torcs 1.0.0 under linux with sources installed. i
assume in this instructions the following:<br>   you have the permisson on the system to do the
needed tasks. the torcs sources  are in /usr/src/torcs/torcs and the installation is in
/usr/local/games/torcs.  in case you use other directories, just replace this directories with the
ones on your system. i also assume that the <a  href="download/berniw.tar.bz2">  berniw.tar.bz2</a>
is in your home directory.
<br>
<br>
first export the following environment variables (for bash):
<br>
export TORCS_BASE=/usr/src/torcs/torcs
<br>
export MAKE_DEFAULT=/usr/src/torcs/torcs/Make-default.mk
<br>
<br>
now change to the drivers directory:
<br>
cd $TORCS_BASE/src/drivers
<br>
<br>
unpack the berniw package:
<br>
tar xfvI ~/berniw.tar.bz2
<br>
<br>
compile and install:
<br>
cd berniw
<br>
make
<br>
make install
<br>
if you discover trouble send me a mail to berni4you@gmx.ch.<br>
<br>
run it:
<br>
cd /usr/local/games/torcs
<br>
./torcs
<br>
now choose a berniw, have fun.
<br>

<h3>1.3 features</h3>
<p>
- pit stop.<br>
- simple collision avoidance.<br>
- stays quite good on various tracks.<br>
</p>

<h3>1.4 todo</h3>
<p>
- bug fixing.<br>
- just compute things if neccessary, not always (partially done) .<br>
- MUCH better trajectory (race and pit, the current one is a big mess) (partially done).<br>
- better collision avoidance.<br>
- overtaking (partially done).<br>
- artwork / different cars.<br>
- setups for the different tracks.<br>
- better strategy.<br>
- communication between berniw's (save fuel behind team mate, block opponents, let pass team mates,
etc.).<br>
- improve behavior model.<br>
- clean up code.<br>
</p>

<h3>1.5 changes</h3>

<h4>19. dec. 2001</h4>
<p>
- added a viper (berniw 4), setups and texture are done.<br>
- added an acura-nsx (berniw 3), setups and texture not done.<br>
- minor code cleanups.<br>
</p>

<h4>18. dec. 2001</h4>
<p>
- Eric released torcs 1.0.0. hurray:-).<br>
- just played a bit with the setups of my cars.<br>
</p>

<h4>17. dec. 2001</h4>
<p>
- added defines in pathfinder.h. you can now choose the trajectory on compile time through defining PATH_K1999 or PATH_BERNIW. if you choose none, the driver will drive on the midde of the track. if you choose both, first a berniw path is generated, then a K1999 optimisation is performed. the reason for having two path's handy is, that you can check, if an idea is "in general" good, and not just on one path.<br>
- added support to take care of bumps (ala dirt-2).<br>
</p>

<h4>15. dec. 2001</h4>
<p>
- hopefully fixed the SIGSEGV bug.<br>
</p>

<h4>13. dec. 2001</h4>
<p>
- fixed a potential bug (never appeared in tests:-)).<br>
- cleanups.<br>
</p>

<h4>12. dec. 2001</h4>
<p>
- performance improvements.<br>
- newlines at *.cpp, *.h files, strange, my gcc 2.95.3 didn't complain?!.<br>
- make all ready to deploy to cvs.<br>
</p>

<h4>10. dec. 2001</h4>
<p>
- added path finding from Remi Coulom, K1999.cpp, (c) by Remi Coulom.<br>
- make all ready to deploy to cvs.
</p>

<h4>7. dec. 2001</h4>
<p>
- simple overtaking.
</p>

<h4>4. dec. 2001</h4>
<p>
- setups for berniw 9, so it stays on every track.<br>
