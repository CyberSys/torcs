<h2>berniw development snapshot for torcs-1.0.0</h2>

<h3>1.0 what is berniw?</h3>

<p>
berniw is a car driver for the open racing car simulator, look at <a href="http://torcs.org">
torcs.org</a>. at this place i would like to thank the developers of torcs, i had a lot of fun
during the development of this driver, they do a great job:-)
</p>

<h3>1.1 license and download</h3>

<p>
gnu general public license 2. anyway, please don't look too hard in the code yet, or my reputation
will be lost...;-). download the latest version <a href="download/berniw20011225.tar.bz2">berniw20011225.tar.bz2</a> here (it's more recent than the one included in 1.0.0). if you get the CVS
version of torcs, you don't need this package, berniw is already included.
</p>

<h4>1.1.1 older versions</h4>
<p>
- <a href="download/berniw20011103.tar.bz2">berniw20011103.tar.bz2</a> for torcs 1.0.0-pre7.<br>
</p>

<h3>1.2 how do i install berniw?</h3>

<p>
so, first you need a working version of torcs 1.0.0 under linux with sources installed. i
assume in this instructions the following:<br>
you have the permisson on the system to do the needed tasks. the torcs sources  are in /usr/src/torcs/torcs and the installation is in
/usr/local/games/torcs.  in case you use other directories, just replace this directories with the
ones on your system. i also assume that the <a  href="download/berniw20011225.tar.bz2">berniw20011225.tar.bz2</a>
is in your home directory.<br>
<br>
first export the following environment variables (for bash):<br>
export TORCS_BASE=/usr/src/torcs/torcs<br>
export MAKE_DEFAULT=/usr/src/torcs/torcs/Make-default.mk<br>
<br>
now change to the drivers directory:<br>
cd $TORCS_BASE/src/drivers<br>
<br>
unpack the berniw package (where YYYYMMDD means the version you got, eg. 20011225):<br>
tar xfvI ~/berniwYYYYMMDD.tar.bz2<br>
<br>
compile and install:<br>
cd berniw<br>
make<br>
make install<br>
if you discover trouble send me a mail to berni4you@gmx.ch.<br>
<br>
run it:<br>
cd /usr/local/games/torcs<br>
./torcs<br>
now choose a berniw, have fun.<br>
</p>

<h3>1.3 features</h3>
<p>
- pit stop.<br>
- simple collision avoidance.<br>
- stays quite good on various tracks.<br>
- overtaking.
</p>

<h3>1.4 todo</h3>
<p>
- bug fixing (hmm, hard to know...).<br>
- just compute things if neccessary, not always (partially done) .<br>
- better trajectory (race, pit is nice) (partially done).<br>
- better collision avoidance (partially done).<br>
- overtaking (partially done).<br>
- artwork / different cars.<br>
- setups for the different tracks.<br>
- better strategy.<br>
- communication between berniw's (save fuel behind team mate, block opponents, let pass team mates,
etc.).<br>
- improve behavior model.<br>
- clean up code, perhaps a complete rewrite.<br>
</p>

<h3>1.5 would you like to get involved?</h3>
<p>
if you are interested, you can tune the setups for the cars. they are in the berniw 1-10 directories, named according to the track. if you have a good one, it's welcome, of course (berni4you@gmx.ch).<br>
</p>

<h3>1.6 contributors</h3>
<p>
- texture of berniw 5 has been done by my brother sam:-)<br>
</p>

<h3>1.7 changes</h3>

<h4>25. jan. 2002</h4>
<p>
- minor changes and cleanups.<br>
</p>

<h4>4. jan. 2002</h4>
<p>
- minor cleanups (comments, regrouped some code, ...).<br>
</p>

<h4>29. dec. 2001</h4>
<p>
- tried things out (speed dependent margins, ...), improved overtake().<br>
</p>

<h4>27. dec. 2001</h4>
<p>
- did some testing, races are with new overtake more spectacular, so the show improves;-).<br>
- texture for viper.<br>
- setups for acura-nsx and viper on e-track-4.<br>
</p>


<h4>26. dec. 2001</h4>
<p>
- improved and changed overtake() a bit.<br>
- setups for acura-nsx and viper on e-track-1.<br>
</p>

<h4>23-25. dec. 2001</h4>
<p>
- tried to improve overtaking and breaking, try it out.<br>
- reworked some code, later a merge of overtake() and collision () has to be done for efficiency.<br>
</p>

<h4>19. dec. 2001</h4>
<p>
- added a viper (berniw 4), setups and texture are not done.<br>
- added an acura-nsx (berniw 3), setups and texture not done.<br>
- minor code cleanups.<br>
</p>

<h4>18. dec. 2001</h4>
<p>
- Eric released torcs 1.0.0. hurray:-).<br>
- just played a bit with the setups of my cars.<br>
</p>

<h4>17. dec. 2001</h4>
<p>
- added defines in pathfinder.h. you can now choose the trajectory on compile time through defining PATH_K1999 or PATH_BERNIW. if you choose none, the driver will drive on the midde of the track. if you choose both, first a berniw path is generated, then a K1999 optimisation is performed. the reason for having two path's handy is, that you can check, if an idea is "in general" good, and not just on one path.<br>
- added support to take care of bumps (ala dirt-2).<br>
</p>

<h4>15. dec. 2001</h4>
<p>
- hopefully fixed the SIGSEGV bug.<br>
</p>

<h4>13. dec. 2001</h4>
<p>
- fixed a potential bug (never appeared in tests:-)).<br>
- cleanups.<br>
</p>

<h4>12. dec. 2001</h4>
<p>
- performance improvements.<br>
- newlines at *.cpp, *.h files, strange, my gcc 2.95.3 didn't complain?!.<br>
- make all ready to deploy to cvs.<br>
</p>

<h4>10. dec. 2001</h4>
<p>
- added path finding from Remi Coulom, K1999.cpp, (c) by Remi Coulom.<br>
- make all ready to deploy to cvs.
</p>

<h4>7. dec. 2001</h4>
<p>
- simple overtaking.
</p>

<h4>4. dec. 2001</h4>
<p>
- setups for berniw 9, so it stays on every track.<br>
- little strategy (refueling: laps behind leader) change in berniw.cpp.<br>
</p>
